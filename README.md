# GEBExtractor and TR2Edit

- these tools are great for editing dlcs

- Note: mission.tr2 and npc.tr2 on the dlcs will override the clean iso version of mission.tr2 and npc.tr2 atleast from what i've experience

- Also learn about single-byte and double-byte characters since GEB JP tends to hate single byte texts (yeah it doesnt like english since it uses single-byte)

- Make a backup on your dlcs or else

- i do not own this tool its from https://github.com/nyirsh/GEBUtils i just compiled it

- some GEBExtractor commands dont work but the tool works normally and i'll fix them some other time
